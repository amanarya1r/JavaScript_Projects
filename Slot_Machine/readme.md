## How slot machineðŸŽ° works? 
We there will be three line like this 

| A | A | A | 
|---|---|---|
| B | B | A |
| C | C | A |
 
So there will be three rows, from one of which a user can win if there will be three symbols which matches in a row, otherwill not win if symbols mismatch. 

| ~~A~~ | ~~A~~ | ~~A~~ | 
|---|---|---|
| B | B | A |
| C | C | A |

So if a user bet on a row line for a certain ammount then it get multiplied as per the row line(suppose if 1 row line is selected than it would be multiplied for once, if two then it would be mutliplied for twice and if three then it would be multiplied for thrice).
